     <strong>This PieChart is talking about percentage of Vulnerability and Headers Severities .To help you better decide which vulnerabilities should be fixed first, we classified the severities into 4 categories : Critical, Medium, 
      Low, Best practice. </strong>

      <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">1) Critical Severity :</span>  The vulnerabilities marked as Critical Severity can allow attackers to execute code on the web application or application server, or access sensitive data.


      <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">2) Medium Severity :</span> The vulnerabilities marked as Medium Severity usually arise because of errors and deficiencies in the application configuration. By exploiting these security issues, malicious attackers can access sensitive information on the application or server.



      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">3) Low Severity :</span>  The vulnerabilities marked as Low Severity are usually not critical, but they can still be exploited by attackers to access sensitive information on the application or server.  </p>


      <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">4) Best Practice :</span> The vulnerabilities are marked as Best Practice are recommendations for an extra security layer, defense in depth and to help continually contribute to the security of your web applications.

      <p>The report is generated based on the results of the vulnerability scanning process on <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 22px; "><u>tryhackme.com</u></span>. The report includes information about the headers, cookies and open ports that were detected during the scan.
      The report also includes information about the severity of the vulnerabilities, the impact of the vulnerabilities on the web application and how to remediate them.</p>

      
      <p>The scanning process found <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 22px; "><u>9</u></span> vulnerabilities (headers and cookies) and <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 22px; "><u>4</u></span> open ports.
        In order to remediate them, you need to check the vulnerabilities in the report and then use the information to remediate the vulnerabilities. </p>
